        <h4>Hash Browns, Sausage & Eggs Casserole!</h4>
        <p>This breakfast casserole with hash browns is my family's recipe that has been handed down through the years. 
        <p>We've always used the maple-flavored pork sausage but any kind is good.</p>
        This casserole is a nice and cozy breakfast or brunch meal that everyone will enjoy. 
        It's got the perfect taste with lots of cheese. Yum! 
        <p><b>Be sure to use a baking dish that is deep enough to cover with aluminum foil.</b></p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (2 pound) package frozen hash brown potatoes, thawed</li>
            <li>1 pound pork sausage</li> 
            <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
            <li>5 eggs</li>
            <li>½ cup milk</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>12 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square pan; add hash brown potatoes and arrange in an even layer.</li>
            <li>Place sausage and onion in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir until the sausage is browned and crumbled, about 10 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, whisk eggs, milk, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl until well combined; pour over the potatoes and sprinkle with 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese. Add sausage mixture on top and sprinkle with remaining Cheddar. Cover with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Remove foil; return casserole to the oven and bake until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 10 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
